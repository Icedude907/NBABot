### A Discord.js bot which keeps you up with the latest scores.

## Commands
### Basic Commands
#### `nba help`
This command shows you the commands which are available;
#### `nba ping`
This command simply shows you the ping (how long it takes for the bot to recieve your request).
### `nba uptime`
This command shows you how long the current session of NBABot has been online for. If it's a short time then I would've been working on it.
### NBA Commands
#### `nba scores`
This command tells you the live scores for the day with an overview or important part of the game.
